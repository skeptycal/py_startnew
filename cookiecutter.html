One thing prevalent in most data science departments is messy notebooks and
messy code. There *are* examples of beautiful notebooks out there, but for the
most part notebook code is rough … really rough. Not to mention all the files,
functions, visitations, reporting metrics, etc. scattered through files and
folders with no real structure to them. I have bee guilty of going back to a
previous projects, searching for the `matplotlib` function I’ve written 50
times before that creates a certain graph with a certain metric. And, I found
it in cell 200 after searching through a few different notebooks. Not efficient
at all. Now consider a project you’re currently doing, and think if are you
making this harder or easier for yourself in a few weeks time when you need to
come back and review the code, or find something specific like a figure or the
original data set? One of the creeds some software development is not to repeat
yourself. So, let’s find out how we can do that. Also, I give a lot of credit

Git should be standard for most data scientists, but it’s not at the moment.
I’ve seen Git used as a place just to store final work but it should be used
throughout the project and a way for the entire team to collaborate with each
other. I use it because I forget why I’ve made certain changes to a file, and
want a way to review my work with annotations and versions. If you don’t have
an account, get one

and start keeping track of your code. I won’t go over the entire process, but

will show you how to get your first `$ git commit -m "My first commit message"`
and `$ git push` for your project. Now you can have version control over each
project because every commit is simply a new version saved which can be
referenced. Once you start pushing code, the thing that will slow productivity
to a halt after reviewing a 6-month project with 100s of commits, will be
reading your old commit messages and asking “WTF does this mean?” To solve this
problem, make sure all your messages are in the

  >imperative mood</a

<blockquote name="c8db" id="c8db" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">
  A properly formed Git commit subject line should always be able to complete
  the following sentence:

This will help greatly when you’re making different models. In the past, I
would have `modelv1.h5`, `modelv2.h5`, etc. and I could not remember why each
of them was different or why I changed the weighting on something. With Git, I
can now just use one name `model.h5` and put my update comments in the commit
message. E.g. I know I’ve added a new layer in my Keras model so my commit
message would be `$ git commit -m "Add additional layer with 50 neurons"`. If I
ever need to go back and see what was involved in a certain model I’ll be able
to view or

to particular commit and see the work I’ve done. This saves so much time. Trust
me. **$ virtualenv** Now that we have version control down, let’s look at
making sure someone else can reproduce our work with a virtual environment. I
was against using virtual environments when I first started learning data
science because they seemed like a pain to set up and maintain. However, they
will save so much headache as your project grows and you need to start sharing
information. More on them

  class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor"
  target="_blank"
  >here</a
>. The main reason for using virtual environments is package version control
for packages and allowing you to easily import custom functions from different
parts of your project, keeping you organized. Someone might be using `pandas
0.23` but you’re using `pandas 0.19`, and you don’t want to upgrade because
it’s going to break something in another project. By having a virtual
environment you’ll be able to start with a fresh new version of Python — it’s
like getting a new car — and install packages with specific versions directly
into each project without any conflict from anything you might have previously
installed. So, you’ll be able to have project `Foo` using `pandas 0.23` and
then project `Bar` using `pandas 0.19`, without any chance of conflict with
each other. If you don’t have the required packages to set up your virtual
environment, you can get them by following the instructions below. # Get a
virtual environment # Python2 $ pip install virtualenv # Python3.6+ # Already
installed with venv Now let’s set up the environment. # Python 2: $ virtualenv
env # Python 3.6+ $ python3 -m venv &lt;&lt;name_of_directory&gt;&gt; If your
directory does not exist, specify what you want as `name_of_directory` and it
will be created. Else, the `venv` will just be installed into the chosen
directory. Once that is done, activate your environment. $ source
name_of_directory/bin/activate If all goes well, you should see a change in
your terminal’s prompt showing the name of the environment on the command line.
And, to deactivate the environment, just run `$` `deactivate` in the root of
your project.

which creates your project structure. There is *a lot* with this package that
is useful, but I’ve found when I’m just doing projects on my own I don’t need
all of the features and packages provided. And, that’s ok. Because every
project is different and you’ll have different requirements depending on what
you work on.The package is structured so that you should only keep the features
you need, and if you find a structure that works you’re able to import it
easily on the next project. Installation and using it is easy. Just two lines
of code to run. # Install $ pip3 install cookiecutter # cd to the directory you
want to start a new project in `cookiecutter
https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science` That is not the only
structure available, as you can look through some additional options

viz.py` If someone wants to recreate your project with the same package
versions, all you need to do is export the list with `freeze` so they can
install the same versions as the project. `# In project root` `$ pip freeze
&gt; requirements.txt` # And to install the packages $ pip install -r
requirements.txt **Data Folders** I think this is one of the most import
sections of cookiecutter. The `data/` folders that allow you to organize
yourself and control your data sources. It is so simple that I should have been
organizing my projects like this from the start. There are four standard
folders:

<ul class="postList">
  <li name="44b1" id="44b1" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">External;</li>
  <li name="c210" id="c210" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Interim;</li>
  <li name="0a25" id="0a25" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">
    Processed, and;
  </li>
  <li name="b049" id="b049" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Raw.</li>
</ul>

By segmenting your data this way you’ll be able to save your in-progress work,
and ensure that your raw data has an immutable folder to live in. You’ll also
be able to quickly and logically access your data rather than just importing a
single lump `.csv` which may or may not be immutable. No more accidentally
saving over the raw data because everything was stored in the same folder, or
dealing with file names like `dataV1.csv` or `finalV1.csv`, because everything
will be (should be) put in its own place. **Documenting The Project** Not a
huge concern, a lot of data science projects are done in Jupyter which allows
the reader to (hopefully) follow the project logically. Allowing others to
reproduce the work, should they have access to the correct packages and the
same data the author had. And now that cookiecutter has segmented the project
more, the notebooks should be easier to read rather than a mess of code,
functions, and results as they have been moved to other parts of the project.
E.g. Your `matplotlib` functions can now live in `./src/viz` and all the
results from these functions can be saved to `./reports/figures`. **Get Your
Functions In** I used to have cells scattered all over my notebooks with custom
functions, that I would later use in the project. And, the more I would write
the harder it became to keep track of them all for the project. Let alone try
to debug them or test them. Even finding them for a project in the future to
reuse became a major pain. Later I would write all my function in
`.src/funct/Foo.py` and stash them in different folders for some semblance of
organization much like an actual software project. This would allow me to
partition my project, so my notebook had the structure of the what was being
analyzed while the functions lived in `Foo.py`, and were imported into my
notebook. .src/ # Main Folder `└──funct/ # Sub Folder ├── Foo.py # Class with
custom methods └── __init__.py` However, I would need to import the files into
my notebook like this. # Meanwhile in my old notebooks ... import os currDir =
os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath("__file__")) rootDir =
os.path.abspath(os.path.join(currDir, '..')) sys.path.insert(1, rootDir +
'/src/funct') # import func package # Now I can finally import Foo from the
funct package from func import Foo print(Foo.foo()) # 'foo' Not very elegant at
all, and prone to checking Stack Overflow on how to use `os.path.dirname` and
`os.path.realpath` correctly. Now, with cookiecutter, you’re able to easily
link everything in your `./src/` with your notebook so you can `import` the
`Foo.py` directly. # Link ./src/ with your notebook # Run this in the project
root $ pip3 install --editable . &gt;&gt;Obtaining
file:///Users/foo/cookiecutter/cookiecutter-template &gt;&gt;Installing
collected packages: src &gt;&gt;Running setup.py develop for src
&gt;&gt;Successfully installed src $ pip3 list Package Version Location
---------- ------- ------------------------------------------------------- pip
18.0 setuptools 39.0.1 src 0.1.0 /Users/foo/cookiecutter/cookiecutter-template
So this allows us to use the `./src` folders provided with cookiecutter to
easily import custom functions into your notebook. And, allow us to have a
common location to put custom functions for easy retrieval for later projects.
# Back in my notebook from src.funct import Foo print(Foo.foo()) # foo Note, if
you do have issues with `pip3 install — editable .` and you cannot import your
`/src` package, try `$ python setup.py develop — no-deps` in the project root.
If that still does not work just copy and paste this code at the top of your
notebook. It will allow you to import `src` as a package. However, this is not
suggested. if __name__ == '__main__' and __package__ is None: from os import
sys, path sys.path.append(path.dirname(path.dirname(path.abspath("__file__"))))
**Using Jupter and Atom Together** It’s inefficient to write all the `*.py`
files in Jupyter, so instead use an IDE which has a linter, interactive
debugger, and other features that make it more preferable to writing *some*
code your project. Jupyter has its strengths, but there are some things that
only an IDE can do. Usually, I use IntelliJ or PyCharm. However, because not
everyone has access to that editor I’ll show the examples in Atom. It also has
an

feature now, so it will be easier to run debugging within this editor.

So let’s run this editor next to our Juptyer notebook. Just split (as shown
below) your screen, with one side with Jupyter and one with the IDE. As a note,
you need to make sure you have two magic functions imported at the beginning of
your notebook. %load_ext autoreload#%autoreload 2 The suffix `2` is used after
`autoreload`, to reload all modules every time *before* executing the Python
code typed. This will enable us to edit functions in Atom, debug them, and
quickly import the code into our notebook, rather than having to write out a
debug the function directly in Jupyter. I’ve made a gif to illustrate how this
looks in practice.

With the IDE up and running next to Jupyter, not only are you able to easily
edit your files but you can also view your entire project easily rather than
having to flip back and forth between windows in your browser. **Final
Thoughts** At the beginning of the article, I outlined the five things I think
about when doing projects, and I hope each point has been explained with the
“how” I approach each of them.

<ol class="postList">
  <li name="e901" id="e901" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">
    Implementing version control (Git)
  </li>
  <li name="58d9" id="58d9" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">

  </li>
  <li name="c12e" id="c12e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">

  </li>
  <li name="4209" id="4209" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">

  </li>

Of course, all of this is all made possible with cookiecutter. Without this
package, I would still be writing mediocre code in a disorganized mess.
However, I’m now able to more easily organize myself, and most importantly,
find old code to reuse in future projects. I hope these methods outlined help
you on your next project, and you’ve learned something new. Cheers.
